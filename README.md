# Student Class Project

## Description
This project implements a `Student` class in Java. The class models a student and includes attributes such as name, student ID, major, and GPA. It contains a method called `displayInfo()` that prints the student's information in a formatted manner.

## How the Class Meets the Requirements
1. **Attributes**:
    - The `Student` class has four key attributes:
        - `name`: the name of the student.
        - `studentID`: a unique identifier for the student.
        - `major`: the student's major.
        - `GPA`: the student's average grade point.

2. **Constructors**:
    - The class includes a parameterized constructor that initializes all attributes and a default constructor that sets default values.

3. **Methods**:
    - The `displayInfo()` method: outputs the student's information to the console.
    - An additional method was removed to simplify the class structure.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your computer:
   git clone https://github.com/mahominato/StudentClass.git
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Compile and run the `Student` class to create instances of students and display their information.

## Project Structure
- `src/Student.java`: the main class of the project, containing the implementation of the `Student` class.
- `diagram.png`: UML diagram representing the structure of the class.
- `README.md`: file containing project description and usage instructions.
